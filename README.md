# Epidemiological-Modeling
Welcome to my project on epidemiological modeling of infectious diseases. Here, I leverage mathematical and computational methods to unravel and predict the dynamics of disease spread within populations.
My primary focus is on the SIR model and it enhanced version, providing deeper insights into how we can effectively control and mitigate outbreaks
